The idea of the current setup is to use the linaro toolchain for compiling the
C++ since the GNAT toolchain for ARM does not have a C++ compiler.
We managed to compile and ruin C++ and Ada together on X86_64, but
we did not manage to do the same on ARM.

+ Solutions:
  + We had to use the linaro compiler as a C++ compiler, as well as final linker.
  + We produce an executable that we can strip and test

+ Problems encountered:
  + undefined reference `__cxxa_pure_virtual()`
    We did not manage to get rid of that error, it is related to our use of
    heritance for our instructions. This message disappears when we compile with
    `-O3`

  + We use g++ for linking but we did not manage to remove 
    "-nolibc" and change it with "-nostdlib" in the command
    generated by gprbuild.

  + undefined reference to `__sync_synchronize`
    * Those builtins are used to guarantee threadsafe static initialization,
      but they are not present for our target.
      To get rid of that error, we disable the functionnality by adding
      `-fno-threadsafe-statics` to config.gpr

  + undefined reference to `__aeabi_ldivmod'
    * Related to the use of 64bits division, we did not manage to fix that error

To conclude, I think that we did not know how to use gprbuild correctly in order
to produce correctly cross-compiled code, maybe next time we should use a tool
that we know how to use such as a Makefile.


* `Quirks` of the bindings generator encountered:
   + Skipped functions but not skipped variables ?
   + Enum declared in classes are not supported
   + Classes that are inherited are considered abstract objects
   + Cannot have overloaded functions based on constness
   + The binding generator does not work very well with templated types

Maybe not the right linaro compiler, we miss a library for hard float with the
fpu of the stm32f746
